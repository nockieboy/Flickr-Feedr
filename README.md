# Flickr-Feedr

Simple single-page application to pull an image feed from Flickr's API and display it in a browser.

It has been updated to utilise backbone and a little jQuery.

Currently, the feed:

* Uses a backbone model and view to present the photos
* Has a user-defineable search
* Produces an 'infinite scrolling' output
* Displays image title, author & image tags when the user hovers their mouse over the image in question
* Title and author are hyperlinks to relevant locations in Flickr, tags are clickable and result in a search on that tag

To do:

* All done!
